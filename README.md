# Navigating Reddit's Political Terrain Through LDA-Powered Topic Modelling

## Abstract
Our project, building upon the foundation laid by the [referenced research paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04167-x), endeavors to uncover the intricacies of online polarization within the most polarized subreddits. By applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to comments from politically divided communities, we aim to dissect the main topics discussed, discerning whether they align with the subreddit's purpose or stem from political perspectives. The project's motivation lies in comprehending the origins of polarization identified in the paper, shedding light on the thematic underpinnings of divisive online discourse. Through data cleaning, anonymization, and LDA modeling, we seek to draw meaningful insights. The main visualization, a 2D plane depicting the topic spread via multidimensional scaling, will offer a visual narrative of the prevalent themes, enabling conclusions about the relationship between discussed topics, subreddit descriptions, and political views.

## Research Questions
Primary: *What are the predominant topics discussed in the comments of the most polarized subreddits, and to what extent do these align with the subreddit's title/description versus reflecting political views?*
> Additional Questions (EDIT THESE)
> - How does the identified topic distribution vary between the most polarized subreddits on the left and right sides of the political spectrum?
> - Are the topics driving polarization on Reddit temporally aligned with external events, and if so, how does this temporal alignment manifest in the comments of the most polarized subreddits?
> - How does the individual-level polarization, if identified, manifest within the comments of the most polarized subreddits, and what role do new users play in the observed system-level shift during 2016 in polarization?

## Organization within the team
Considering both my teammate and I have similar schedules, we will be pair programming the entire project. Instead of dividing the work evenly, we prefer working together on every aspect as we can share ideas.
